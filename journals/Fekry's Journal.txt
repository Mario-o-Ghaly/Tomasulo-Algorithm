** 5/11 11:59 PM
	we Initialized the project by creating a C++ program for simulating the Tomasulo Algorithm together.

**6/11 11:59 PM
	Implemented data structures, including a class for instructions (Inst class) and used maps to represent memory and reservation stations together.

** 7/12 2:00 PM
	Developed the execution logic, including stages for issue, execution start, execution end, and write-back together

** 9/11 11:59 PM
	Implemented functions for printing instruction details and reading hardware specifications.

** 10/11 11:59 PM
	Addressed hazards, such as RAW hazards, during the simulation together.

** 11/11 11:59 PM
	supported the bonus feature together.

** 11/12 2:00 PM
	write and simulate inst2.txt (the second test case). I also documented its results in the report.
